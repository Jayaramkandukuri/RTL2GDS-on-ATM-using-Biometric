addRing command will consider rows while creating rings.
The ring targets are set to core/block ring wires.
addStripe will allow jog to connect padcore ring and block ring.

Stripes will not extend to closest target.
When breaking rings, the power planner will consider the existence of blocks.
addStripe will break automatically at non-default domains when generating global stripes over the core area or default domain.
The entire stripe set will break at the domain if one of the nets is not in the domain.
Stripes will not be created over regions without power planning wires.
Offset for stripe breaking is set to 0.
Stripes will stop at the boundary of the specified area.
The power planner will set stripe antenna targets to none (no trimming allowed).
